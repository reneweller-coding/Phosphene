 * @file Ladder.h
 * @brief Four-pole transistor ladder low pass, zero-delay feedback, nonlinear, as a lane template.
 *
 * **Model.** The Moog ladder's four stages obey dy_i/dt = w (tanh(y_{i-1}) - tanh(y_i)), with the
 * input stage fed tanh(x - k y_4) (Huovilainen, "Non-linear digital implementation of the Moog
 * ladder filter", DAFx 2004). Discretised with trapezoidal integrators in the topology-preserving
 * form, the feedback loop has no unit delay (Zavalishin, "The Art of VA Filter Design", ch. 5),
 * which keeps the cutoff and the resonance peak where they belong up to Nyquist.
 *
 * **Solving the nonlinear loop cheaply.** An exact zero-delay solution needs an iterative solve per
 * sample. Instead each nonlinearity is replaced by its local gain tanh(v)/v, evaluated at the
 * previous sample's value of v. With those gains fixed, the loop is linear and is solved in closed
 * form; the next sample updates the gains. This is the method T. Voipio published as "cheap
 * non-linear zero-delay filters" (KVR forum, 2012); it keeps the ZDF tuning, self-oscillates
 * cleanly and costs one division and one square root per stage.
 *
 * **Saturation curve.** The gain uses the algebraic sigmoid v / sqrt(1 + v^2) rather than tanh:
 * it is bounded, smooth, a little softer than tanh, and needs only a square root and a division --
 * both single IEEE operations, so the lane path is bit-identical to the scalar path (see Vec.h).
 *
 * **Derivation of the closed form.** With gains t_i, stage i is y_i = (s_i + g t_{i-1} y_{i-1}) /
 * (1 + g t_i), i.e. y_i = A_i y_{i-1} + B_i. Chaining gives y_4 = P u + Q with P = A_4 A_3 A_2 A_1
 * and Q = A_4 A_3 A_2 B_1 + A_4 A_3 B_2 + A_4 B_3 + B_4. The input u = x - k y_4 then solves to
 * u = (x - k Q) / (1 + k P). The integrator states update as s_i <- 2 y_i - s_i.
 *
