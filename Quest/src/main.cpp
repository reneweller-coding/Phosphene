/**
 * @file main.cpp
 * @brief Phosphene for Meta Quest: the whole generator on the headset, played with the hands.
 *
 * No game engine -- `NativeActivity` + `android_native_app_glue`, EGL, GLES 3, the Khronos OpenXR
 * loader, `XR_EXT_hand_tracking`, Oboe for audio, and the unchanged core from `../Core`.
 *
 * **Three threads.**
 *  - *Audio* (Oboe): `SetPlayer::process` runs `Engine::process` and the play/stop fade. It never
 *    allocates, never locks and never blocks: while the composer thread holds the player it writes
 *    silence and returns.
 *  - *Composer*: plans tracks, composes bars and fills the engine's event rings a few bars ahead
 *    (the same job `Conductor` does offline, with the bar offset a track jump needs), and publishes
 *    what the panel shows. On the Quest this is meant for one of the small A55 cores.
 *  - *Render* (the glue thread): OpenXR frame loop, hands, gestures, the picture.
 *
 * **Performer, not editor** (docs/PLAN.md 8.2). A head-locked panel of dots shows the track, the
 * 16-bar block and what plays in it, key, tempo, loudness and the two macros; the hands do the rest:
 *
 * | Gesture | Effect |
 * |---|---|
 * | left pinch | play / stop (a 15 ms fade, the music pauses where it is) |
 * | right pinch | next track (the conductor rewinds to that track's first bar) |
 * | left hand height | `mix.track_gain`, -12 to +12 dB, mid height = 0 dB |
 * | right hand height | acid cutoff, two octaves either way around the composed value |
 *
 * A hand only moves its macro while it is *not* pinching, so the gesture that starts a track does
 * not also yank the gain. Both macros are centred and smoothed with a 0.15 s one-pole: a hand at
 * mid height plays exactly what the composer wrote, and nothing ever jumps (the continuity rule).
 *
 * **Files in `<externalDataPath>`** (`/sdcard/Android/data/com.reneweller.phosphene.quest/files`):
 * @code
 *   phos.cfg    mute=1          start silent (the test rule; the engine still runs)
 *               seed=2026       set seed
 *               quality=quest   quest (default here) or desktop
 *               osc_host=192.168.1.20   optional cue bridge to Kaleidoscope (PLAN 8.3)
 *               osc_port=9000
 *               osc_beats=0     leave out /phos/beat, the busiest of the five messages
 *               osc_lead_ms=12  trim: how much deeper the device's own buffering is than one block
 *               set=compose.bpm=146;compose.pad_amount=1     any knobs, repeatable
 *   library.phoswt   optional: a wavetable pack pushed to the device, used instead of the one in
 *                    the APK (see prepareWaveTables)
 * @endcode
 *
 * **The shipped wavetable library** rides in the APK as an asset and is unpacked once into the
 * app's private directory, because the core opens its resources by name and an asset has none. At
 * the Quest quality level it is built with 32 of its 64 frames (Quality.h), which takes the
 * expanded mip levels from 23.3 MB to 12.1 MB and the load from 110 ms to 71 ms.

 * @brief Engine, composer and the bar pump, with a play/stop fade and a jump to the next track.

 * `Conductor` (Composer.h) does the pumping offline, but it always starts at bar 0 and has no way
 * to move the play position, which the "next track" gesture needs. This class does the same job
 * with a bar offset: the engine always plays from its own beat 0, and every composed event is moved
 * back by the beat of `barOffset_`, so bar 700 of the set can be the first bar the engine sees. The
 * tempo map is rebased the same way. Nothing in the core had to change for it.
 *
 * **Handover.** `state_` is the only synchronisation between the audio thread and the composer
 * thread. The audio thread takes it from Idle to Processing with one compare-and-exchange and puts
 * it back; if it cannot (the composer holds it for a reset), it writes silence and returns. The
 * composer waits for Idle and takes it to Blocked. The audio thread therefore never blocks and
 * never allocates.
